# Input Verifier

## Background
This is an experiment on some front-end work.  I wanted to create an
input control that dynamically provided validation feedback on the
text being entered.

It verifies words against a small list of valid words.   If the word is not
found in the list it will be displayed in red, otherwise it will be displayed
in black.

All validation takes place on a background thread so as not to distrupt the user.
